            <p><b>Some people think that good health is essential to everyone, so medical service should not be run by pro-fit making company. Do the advantages of private healthcare outweigh the advantage?”</b></p>
            <p>Nowadays the trend of commercialization has taken place in many aspect of life and even healthcare service is not an exception. However, there are some claims against hospitals run by for-profit organizations. Taking both pros and cons of this type of medical supplier into consideration, there should be a sensible balance between the number of private and public hospitals.</p>
            <p>On the one hand, there are various reasons for objecting to the privatization of medical services. Moral Issues seem to capture the most concern of people . it is claimed that the staff of such organizations are merely concerned profitable patients and they would even refuse anyone who cannot afford to pay the charges immediately. In addition, the private hospitals are also blamed for increasing the injustice in society. The fact is that escalating costs of healthcare and the unwillingness of insurance companies to cover these costs have severely restricted access to good healthcare for the poor.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it cannot be denied that private hospital prove to be preeminent over the ones funded by government in some extents. First of all, thanks to the the great financial investment, private healthcare services can serve patients with latest medical facilities. The existence of private healthcare system is also a solution to the fact that public hospitals are always overloaded. If there were only sate medical centres, there would not be enough supply for the increasing need in medical treatment . Moreover, competition between two modes of hospital in delivery of healthcare is supposed to result in a more sufficient and effective healthcare system.</p>
            <p>All things considered, the privatization of medical services is not totally a negative trend. Despite some rumors relating to the the expense and morality, private hospital play an important role in meeting human basic needs. Therefore if the quality and number of private hospitals are put under reasonable control, this type of healthcare service can be a positive factor of a modern society.</p>
